Description: Bayesian MCPMod (Fleischer et al. (2022)
    <doi:10.1002/pst.2193>) is an innovative method that improves the
    traditional MCPMod by systematically incorporating historical data,
    such as previous placebo group data. This R package offers functions
    for simulating, analyzing, and evaluating Bayesian MCPMod trials with
    normally distributed endpoints.  It enables the assessment of trial
    designs incorporating historical data across various true
    dose-response relationships and sample sizes. Robust mixture prior
    distributions, such as those derived with the Meta-Analytic-Predictive
    approach (Schmidli et al. (2014) <doi:10.1111/biom.12242>), can be
    specified for each dose group.  Resulting mixture posterior
    distributions are used in the Bayesian Multiple Comparison Procedure
    and modeling steps.  The modeling step also includes a weighted model
    averaging approach (Pinheiro et al. (2014) <doi:10.1002/sim.6052>).
    Estimated dose-response relationships can be bootstrapped and
    visualized.
